2. **BSP-low-EW Superior**: BSP-low-EW shaping outperforms base-stock shaping
3. **Faster Convergence**: Shaped methods converge faster and more stably
4. **Statistical Significance**: Improvements are statistically significant
5. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Benefits most pronounced for short lifetimes

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install gymnasium stable-baselines3 torch numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn scipy
```

## Notes

- **Training Time**: Full experiments may take 30-60 minutes
